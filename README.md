# Android Eat Apples
- by: https://github.com/dave2000sang, https://github.com/1298se, and https://github.com/Kevinwen1999
- 2D Python game created using PyGame, implementing face detection using OpenCV library.
- Player controls the sprite through face detection (can move left-right).
- The goal is to catch as many apples without letting any fall through the floor.
- The floor acts as a second life, and may be reset by catching a yellow apple.
- Some obstacles include increasing speed and quantity of apples falling as game progresses.
- Also implemented main menu, instructions page, and leaderboard.

## Possible Future Extension Ideas:
- Improve efficiency & effectiveness of facial recognition (faster and more accurate)
- Implement some kind of pattern to drop the apples (maybe add song beat analyser and drop apples based on beats in a mp3 file)
- ...
