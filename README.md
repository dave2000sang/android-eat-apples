- by: https://github.com/dave2000sang, https://github.com/1298se, and https://github.com/Kevinwen1999
- 2D Python game created using PyGame, implementing face detection using OpenCV library.
- Player controls the sprite through face detection (can move left-right) and goal is to catch the falling apples without letting any fall through.
- The floor acts as a second life, and can be reset by catching a yellow apple.
- Some obstacles include increasing speed and quantity of apples falling as game progresses.
- Also implemented main menu, instructions page, and leadership board.
